### Chapter 2 Getting Started

Now that you have made it to chapter 2, I'm assuming you want to raise your speed stat to be at least higher than Snorlax. If the average American was a pokemon, they'd have a speed stat lower than Snorlax. But DO NOT WORRY. Raising your speed stat is very simple. Much more simple than this problem: 3x + 7 = 16. Got your brain running? Gonna get your legs running soon too.

The most important thing to know about running as a beginner is to not overdo the running part. Everyone starts somewhere and no one should be training like a professional athlete unless they are a professional athlete. Running isn't a thing you can lie about unlike Elon's Diablo 4 account. It takes a long time to build fitness strong enough to run fast and a lot of people may not have the time for it, but most people can at least run enough to stay healthy without commiting a lot of time.

A huge factor for improvement in running is time on feet. This includes, walking, standing, jogging, and whatever you do when you are on your feet (biking counts, not e-bike). The more time you spend, the easier it is for you to run as you accumulate more of this time. A group of researchers once looked at some native Americans that use to walk about 4-8 hours per day around their land (About 10 - 15 miles of walking a day). They never really trained for running except for occasional short sprints. Yet they were able to run a 10 mile race in less than an hour. This averages under 6 minutes per mile for 10 miles in a row and is considered to be the top 0.01% of runners today. This is still not olympic level because its not that fast even though the average American will think it is. Top athletes race 10 miles in around 45 minutes. Most Americans probably average less than 30 minutes a day on feet due to school, work, cars, and netflix. I made that number up but you get the idea.

One of the best and easiest ways to start is to just walk everyday for about 20-30 minutes. Its low impact, almost fully injury free, and accesible to most people. Its one of the easiest forms of aerobic exercise for most people and easy to keep consistent. Once you get a habit of walking everyday, then you can start jogging everyday. The key is to do it as many days of the week as possible. Ideally 5 days and best case scenario is 7. The first goal is to SLOWLY start building up to at least 1 hour of feet time everyday whether its from walking, jogging, and maybe a little bit of running to maximize aerobic power benefits by getting your heart rate to around 120-130 beats per minute.  

Example: Maybe you walk 30 minutes in the morning and then jog 30 minutes in the evening,

Aerobic power is very important along with time on feet. It is your body's energy system used to fat into energy using oxygen.  
Side note: Your body is also burning sugars for energy at the same time during aerobic activities like walking or running, but keeping your heart rate in the low zone of 1-2 will teach your body to burn more fat. (Will expand on later chapters) 

Depending on the fitness level you are starting at, you may already be in the 1 hour of feet time a day and can move on to the next step which is converting this feet time into mostly jogging time with minimal walking time. Just like we saw from Chapter 1:

M: 10 minute walk -> 10 minute slow jog  
T: 20 minute slow jog  
W: 10 minute walk -> 10 minute slow jog  
Th: 20 minute slow jog  
F: 10 minute walk -> 10 minute slow jog  
Sa: 10 minute walk -> 10 minute slow jog  
Su: 20 minute slow jog  

This is ideal for most beginners and of course a little extra time into jogging if you are already comfortable doing this. 

The second thing is to measure by time and not distance. Your heart does not care about how far you ran, it cares about how long it was able to beat at a higher heart rate and how fast it can recover from that higher heart rate back to resting. A strong indicator of cardiovascular fitness is how fast your heart rate can drop from 180bpm back to resting at 50 or 60bpm.  

The third thing is dont fall for random ass training methods, a random youtube video of some runner explaining a detailed running plan not going to get you faster ðŸ’€. These dudes are making content for money and money only. They are as fake as the President's plan to bring up the economy. Even though all runs are not the same, run is a run so just fucking get out there and run.

Lastly, don't fall for marketing scams. No you do not need this electrolyte, or those vitamins or that magical creatine supplement, a specific shoe to run in, or a dumb running vest for a short 5 mile run. I will expand on this in later chapters. These scams are just companies trying to profit off of the growing community of running in the past few decades. Running use to be a cheap sport and will continue to be cheap as long as you don't fall for scams. Just wear a t-shirt + (bra if needed), shorts, socks and shoes ðŸ’€. They will tell us studies that show groundbreaking results for runners, but in reality will only improve your performance by as little as 1%. 

Whether your goal is to become a better calorie burner for weight loss, run your first 5k, or just rebuilding cardiovascular health, time on feet is a huge part of a beginner's journey into running.
