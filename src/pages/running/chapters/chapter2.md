### Chapter 2 Building An Aerobic Base

Now that you have made it to chapter 2, I'm assuming you want to raise your speed stat to be at least higher than Snorlax. If the average American was a pokemon, they'd have a speed stat lower than Snorlax. But DO NOT WORRY. Raising your speed stat is very simple. Much more simple than this problem: 3x + 7 = 16. Got your brain running? Gonna get your legs running soon too.

The most important thing to know about running as a beginner is to not overdo the running part. Running isn't a thing you can lie about unlike Elon's Diablo 4 account. It takes a long time and a lot of patience to build fitness strong enough to run fast. Sometimes you won't see improvement for almost a whole year, but suddenly you will reach power levels harder than gacha game power creeps as long as you are patient and keep consistency.

One of the best and easiest ways to start is to just walk everyday for about 20-30 minutes. Its low impact, almost fully injury free, and accesible to most people. Its one of the easiest forms of aerobic exercise for most people and easy to keep consistent. Once you get a habit of walking everyday, then you can start jogging everyday. The key is to do it as many days of the week as possible. Ideally 5 days and best case scenario is 7. The first goal is to SLOWLY start building up to at least 1 hour of feet time everyday whether its from walking, jogging, and running to maximize aerobic power benefits by getting your heart rate to around 120-130 beats per minute.  

Example: Maybe you walk 30 minutes in the morning and then jog 30 minutes in the evening. 

Aerobic power is very important along with time on feet. It is your body's energy system used to convert fat into energy using oxygen.  
Side note: Your body is also burning sugars for energy at the same time during aerobic activities like walking or running, but keeping your heart rate in the low zone of 1-2 will teach your body to burn more fat. The ratio is around 80%fat/20%sugar (Will expand on later chapters) 

A week 1 plan like this is a perfect start for true beginners:

M: 10 minute walk + 10 minute slow jog  
T: 20 minute slow jog  
W: 10 minute walk + 10 minute slow jog  
Th: 20 minute slow jog  
F: 10 minute walk + 10 minute slow jog  
Sa: 10 minute walk + 10 minute slow jog  
Su: 20 minute slow jog   

Notice how we are measuring by time and not distance. Your heart does not care about how far you ran, it cares about how long it was able to beat at a higher heart rate and how fast it can recover from that higher heart rate back to resting. A strong indicator of cardiovascular fitness is how fast your heart rate can drop from 180bpm back to resting at 50 or 60bpm.  

### Part2: Strength Training

This will be short, but also the most important thing for runners of all levels. Do strength training. Stick with the basics.  
Squats  
Lunges  
Push ups  
Planks  
Sit ups  
Jumping jacks  
Box jumps  
A skips  
B skips  
High Knees  
Butt Kickers  
Burpees  

Do a mixture of these for 20 minutes every other day and you do not need to do all of them in a day, but make sure to touch each exercise at least once a week and focus more on ones you feel weak with.  
Strength training is good for building strong tendons so that the impact of running does not destroy your body. It's your body guard from injury.
There is also too much research that goes on in the metabolic level to explain every benefit of this so just do it along with your running. It's very important that you stick with the basics and ignore the fancy shit you see on youtube though.

Whether your goal is to become a better calorie burner for weight loss, run your first 5k, or just rebuilding cardiovascular health for long term benefits, time on feet is a huge part of a beginner's journey into running. For now, most of your time should be doing very slow and controlled jogging or walking and the goal is to be consistent for it to build a strong aerobic base. 

Here is an example of a good 4 week plan to start with:  
These are only estimations and can be adjusted according to how you feel that day.
Side Note 1000: It does not matter whether you are jogging on a hill, on a treadmill, on sand, or on snow, it might feel hard but your body will slowly adapt if you let it.  
Also stop at stoplights, it doesn't matter and won't affect your overall potential fitness gains.
### Week 1

M: 10 minute walk + 10 minute slow jog + strength training  
T: 20 minute slow jog  
W: 10 minute walk + 10 minute slow jog  + strength training  
Th: 20 minute slow jog  
F: 10 minute walk + 10 minute slow jog  + strength training  
Sa: 10 minute walk + 10 minute slow jog  
Su: 20 minute slow jog  + strength training  
Most of these jogs should be very slow and easy at a heart rate of around 130 if possible (Hard for beginners but it'll drop to this eventually so dont worry about those stats for now)

### Week 2

(Walk this week if needed, but only keep it to less than a minute before jogging again)  
M: 20 minute slow jog + strength training (Walk if needed, but only keep it to less than a minute)  
T: 20 minute slow jog  
W: 20 minute slow jog  + strength training  
Th: 20 minute slow jog  
F: 20 minute slow jog  + strength training  
Sa: 20 minute slow jog  
Su: 30 minute slow jog  + strength training  


### Week 3

This is not a mistake, week 3 is the same as week 2  
M: 20 minute slow jog + strength training  
T: 20 minute slow jog  
W: 20 minute slow jog  + strength training  
Th: 20 minute slow jog  
F: 20 minute slow jog  + strength training  
Sa: 20 minute slow jog  
Su: 30 minute slow jog  + strength training  
If you still feel sore after the end of week 3, repeat week 3.  

### Week 4

M: 25 minute slow jog + strength training  
T: 20 minute slow jog  
W: 25 minute slow jog  + strength training  
Th: 20 minute slow jog  
F: 25 minute slow jog  + strength training  
Sa: 20 minute slow jog  
Su: 40 minute slow jog  + strength training  
If you made it here without being sore, then you are ready for real training. If you are not, 99% of Americans are with you and thats ok. Just repeat whichever week you can handle until you can do week 4 comfortably. Some people take up to 3 months to be able to handle week 4 very well while some only need a few weeks.
