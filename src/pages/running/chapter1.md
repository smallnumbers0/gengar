### Chapter 1 The Expert Of Self Sabotage

That's you. That's all of us. Don't bullshit me. We all do it. Imagine this. Maybe you wanted to get an A on an exam. You got a B. You probably thought: "Oh well if I studied I would have probably gotten an A." Another scenario. Maybe you did not raise your hand in class because you felt like you would look stupid if you got the answer wrong. Or maybe you were the talented kid in basketball who didn't try or practice. Why didn't you try? It's because you think it would make you look bad when the nerds beat you even if you tried so hard to be the best. My point is that we love to protect our sense of self be sabotaging our potential. Trying and giving our all is extremely difficult. It exposes us to ourselves. Coming face to face in knowing if we are actually good enough is a scarier than getting your ass beat by batman. It's important to understand that the problem is not your ego here. The problem is that you are scared of your own ego. The truth is no one cares if you are better or worse than the person next to you except for the ego. Our brain automatically defaults to feeling threatened when we feel challenged by this fact.

So how does this relate to running? It has everything to do with running and also everything else in life. Most people are only an inch away from recognizing their potential, but we are often addicted to the path of ALL IN. We love to say: "I'm gonna go all in to running" or "I'm gonna go all in on coding". The real truth is that going all in onto something significantly decreases your overall potential. Research has shown that a diversity of interests outside of your main pursuit resulted in a higher level of success. This is true for Academia, World Class Athletes, Nobel Prize Winners, and many more. Its incredibly difficult to understand the boundaries of our potentials and we often overestimate it. In reality, we are only inches away, but our society and environments like to gaslight us into showing us that we are far from a high level of elite performance. This is what I call chasing the survival mode. Instead of being able to recognize our super saiyan level, we limit ourselves to what society believes we can be by underestimating our own potential and wasting a lot of time on things that our brains don't enjoy. 

Let me give you can example: You have a Calculus test in a few days. In the past, you studied but did not do so well. You decide that you this time you are gonna go all in and study so fucking hard that you will get an A on the exam. You got a C again. You thought, maybe its the dam doom scrolling again. Stuck as a level 5 pokemon, you begin to wonder if you are just dumb. You are not. Your approach was just all wrong. NEVER EVER go all in on something. Its not about going all in. Most people's brain do not work that way and you are not any different. 

Just like optimizing your improvements in running, its best to do only a little bit each day. An ideal running week plan for a beginner would look like this: 

M: 10 minute walk -> 10 minute slow jog  
T: 20 minute slow jog  
W: 10 minute walk -> 10 minute slow jog  
Th: 20 minute slow jog  
F: 10 minute walk -> 10 minute slow jog  
Sa: 10 minute walk -> 10 minute slow jog  
Su: 20 minute slow jog  
BTW if these feel like you are breathing too hard, then you are going too fast and you need to slow down. These should be EASY and SLOW.

You see how little time this is-less than 21 minutes per day, but is also proven to be super effective in improving running by a lot. Notice how they are not on it for 10 hours doing an all in maxed out session of running hoping they will improve faster. Your timed learning sessions should look like this. Everyday in small chunks at a time. Each small chunk of running or studying is a rare candy. You need time to digest this rare candy. As you do this day by day, week by week, you'll start to notice you absorb information faster than Usain Bolt's world records.

Ok now that we understand the cycle of self sabotage, we can finally get into learning about running ->
